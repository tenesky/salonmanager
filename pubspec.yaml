  # display an offline overlay and retry option.

  # Supabase client for Flutter. Provides authentication, realtime database
  # and Postgres access without needing a custom backend. Used for email
  # OTP login and session handling. This package replaces the previous
  # mysql1 dependency for data access. All database queries should
  # leverage Supabase's PostgREST API via this client.
  supabase_flutter: ^2.5.0

  # Map support using Leaflet. The flutter_map package provides a
  # Flutter implementation of the Leaflet library for interactive
  # maps. latlong2 supplies classes for geographic coordinates.

  # Colour picker for selecting salon branding colours in the

  # selector.

  # Charts for reports and analytics.  The fl_chart package provides
  # line, bar and pie charts used in the ReportsPage dashboards.
  # Use a newer version of fl_chart that is compatible with the latest
  # Flutter versions.  Earlier versions referenced deprecated APIs such as
  # MediaQuery.boldTextOverride which causes compile errors.  The latest
  # version removes these calls and is backwards compatible with our
  # existing chart implementations.
  # Upgrade to a newer version of fl_chart to avoid usage of deprecated
  # MediaQuery.boldTextOverride API on iOS.  Version 1.1.x is
  # compatible with Flutter 3.x and removes the deprecated call.
  fl_chart: ^1.1.1

  # CSV converter for exporting report data.  This dependency
  # simplifies generating CSV strings from lists of maps.
  csv: ^5.0.0

  # Removed aws_s3_client dependency.  The gallery uploads now use the
  # built‑in Supabase storage client via Supabase Flutter.  This avoids
  # relying on an external S3 client library and resolves version
  # conflicts when running `flutter pub get`.
